Forms in Vue 3!

-- 
Create BaseInput type

This allows us to replicate, modify, extend them.
This insures consistency between forms.

$attr

Whenever you pass down attributes in Vue, vue will try and figureout where to inject the attributes,
	This is easier with a single injection point on root level like so,
		<template>
			<div>            <------ Inject
				[...]
			</div>
		</template>

	But with multiple root places it becomes more difficult, Vue will not decide, but rather issue a warning
		<template>
			<label/>       <----here???
			<input/>			 <---- or here??? 
		</template>

	With multipe root level elements, we have to manually bind the $attr
